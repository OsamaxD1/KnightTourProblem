# KnightTourProblem

A knight tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square only once. If the knight ends on a square that is one knights move from the beginning square the tour is closed, otherwise it is open.

The knight tour starts on the cell numbered one and travels to each cell in numerical order,finishing on cell 64.

8x8 board -> 26,534,728,812,064 directed closed tour (2,1) (2,-1) (-2,1) (-2,-1) (1,-2) (-1,-2) (1,2) (-1,2)+ Randomly run on 8x8 Chess board=Success!

The knights tour problem is an instance of the more general Hamiltonian path problem in graph theory. The problem of getting a closed knight tour is similarly an instance of the hamiltonian cycle problem.

A strategy game for you and your computer.
